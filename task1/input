Once upon a time…
It doesn’t seem long ago that I struggled to convince corporate IT that Apache on Linux was not only a viable alternative to IIS, but the superior choice. Whilst I’m not a big fan of windows for web servers – that’s largely a personal preference. IIS is actually a very capable web server; I’ve seen it stand up to quite a pounding. Of course, you need to patch it regularly, but the bottom line is it works perfectly fine. That is, until you try to configure it.
The biggest weakness in IIS is configurability.
Point and clicky configuration really is one of the stupidest ideas to come out of Redmond, particularly when that configuration can’t be edited or diffed as a simple text file. Have you ever tried replicating IIS settings to a DR machine? (Thank goodness for Vmware).
Configuration: Simple, but not stupid!
Apache really wins out in the configuration and configurability department. Apache is far more than just a web server, it’s the undisputed heavyweight champ of HTTP; if you can’t do it in Apache (either you’re doing something wrong, or) you can write a module to do it.
The King is here
In short, Apache is brilliant – it has set the benchmark as the practical, reliable utilitarian web server – it is probably responsible for more Linux server deployments than anything else.
In fact, I’d dare to say that Apache is the killer app for Linux.
I’ve deployed Apache in all shapes and sizes, in many configurations, as web servers, as reverse proxies, behind different load balancers and SSL accelerators – always with success. In short, this is why I don’t believe banking and finance will be in a hurry to move on from Apache and embrace the new darling of the RoR crowd, nginx.
